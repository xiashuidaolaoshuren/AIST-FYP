### Paper Summary: FEVER: a large-scale dataset for Fact Extraction and VERification

**1. Core Research Question (PICO/T):**
- **P (Problem):** At the time of publication, there was a lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets specifically designed for the task of verifying factual claims against textual evidence.
- **I (Intervention):** The authors introduced **FEVER (Fact Extraction and VERification)**, a new, large dataset of 185,445 claims.
- **C (Comparison):** The paper implicitly compares FEVER to previous, smaller-scale fact-checking datasets, highlighting its significant increase in scale and its unique claim generation process.
- **O (Outcome):** The primary outcome was the creation of a challenging benchmark to stimulate research in claim verification. The authors also measured the performance of a baseline system to characterize the dataset's difficulty.
- **T (Theoretical Hypothesis):** The authors hypothesized that by creating a large and challenging dataset, they could drive progress in the NLP community on the complex, multi-step task of fact-checking, which involves both retrieving relevant evidence and classifying a claim's veracity based on that evidence.

**2. Methodology:**
The research methodology involved **dataset creation and benchmarking**.
1.  **Claim Generation:** Claims were generated by altering sentences extracted from Wikipedia. This semi-automatic process created claims that were closely related to real information but could be true, false, or unverifiable.
2.  **Human Annotation:** Annotators, without knowledge of the original source sentence, classified each claim as "Supported," "Refuted," or "NotEnoughInfo." For "Supported" and "Refuted" claims, they were required to identify the specific sentence(s) from Wikipedia that constituted the evidence.
3.  **Baseline System:** A pipeline model was developed to establish a performance baseline. This system included components for document retrieval, sentence selection, and claim classification.

**3. Key Findings:**
- **Creation of a Large-Scale Dataset:** The primary finding is the dataset itself, which was significantly larger and more comprehensive than previous resources.
- **High Inter-Annotator Agreement:** The annotation process was robust, achieving a Fleiss' Îº score of 0.6841, indicating substantial agreement among annotators.
- **Challenging Benchmark:** The baseline system performed poorly, achieving only 31.87% accuracy when required to provide both the correct label and the correct evidence. This demonstrated that the FEVER dataset was a difficult and meaningful challenge for the state-of-the-art models at the time.
- **Two-Fold Challenge:** The task is composed of two distinct sub-problems: first, finding the right evidence (information retrieval), and second, correctly classifying the claim based on that evidence (textual entailment).

**4. Main Contribution:**
The main contribution of this paper is the **creation and public release of the FEVER dataset**. This resource became a standard benchmark in the field and catalyzed a significant amount of research into fact verification, evidence retrieval, and textual entailment. It shifted the focus from small-scale studies to developing robust, large-scale systems.

**5. Limitations:**
- **Synthetic Nature of Claims:** The claims were generated by modifying existing Wikipedia sentences, which may not fully represent the diversity and complexity of real-world misinformation.
- **Focus on Single-Hop Reasoning:** Most claims in FEVER can be verified with a single piece of evidence. The dataset is less suited for evaluating more complex, multi-hop reasoning that requires synthesizing information from multiple sources.
- **Wikipedia as a Single Source:** The dataset is grounded entirely in Wikipedia, so it doesn't address the challenge of verifying claims against the broader, more heterogeneous web.

- Fact Verification
- Dataset
- Textual Entailment
- Information Retrieval
- Natural Language Inference (NLI)
- Claim Verification

**7. Relevance Assessment:**
- **Relevance:** High
- **Reason:** The FEVER dataset and its underlying methodology are foundational to this project. The project's core task of verifying a claim against evidence is precisely the task defined by FEVER. The "Supported/Refuted/NotEnoughInfo" classification scheme and the requirement to cite evidence are directly adopted in the project's design. FEVER will serve as a key training dataset for the verifier module.
