=========================================================
Date: September 11, 2025
Team Size: 2 | Duration: 6 months | GPU: RTX 3070Ti (3090 optional)

This document provides detailed 6-month roadmaps for five selected LLM projects, with the first month dedicated to research and planning.

---

### 5. Hallucination Detection & Mitigation for LLMs
--------------------------------------------------
- **Brief Introduction:** Detect factual hallucinations in LLM outputs and reduce them using a lightweight, plug-and-play verifier module without needing a huge "judge" model.
- **Technical Innovation:** A lightweight verifier ensemble combining retrieval evidence scoring, contradiction detection (NLI), and model uncertainty signals (e.g., self-consistency, entropy).
- **Technical Stack:** Python, Transformers, PEFT (LoRA/QLoRA), Vector DBs (FAISS/Chroma), NLI models (e.g., DeBERTa).
- **Complexity:** Medium.

**6-Month Compact Roadmap:**
- **Month 1: Research & Planning**
  - Review literature on hallucination, fact-checking, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  - Set up hallucination benchmarks (e.g., TruthfulQA, HaluEval) and evidence corpora (e.g., Wikipedia).
  - Design the architecture for the generator-retriever-verifier pipeline.
- **Month 2: Baseline & Retrieval**
  - Implement a baseline RAG system.
  - Build and optimize the retrieval module (e.g., hybrid BM25 + dense retriever).
- **Month 3: Verifier Module - Part 1**
  - Implement uncertainty signal detection (entropy, self-consistency).
  - Train a simple evidence alignment scorer to check if claims are supported by retrieved documents.
- **Month 4: Verifier Module - Part 2**
  - Fine-tune a small NLI model to act as a contradiction detector between the LLM's claim and the evidence.
  - Combine all signals into an ensemble verifier.
- **Month 5: Mitigation & Evaluation**
  - Implement mitigation strategies (e.g., trigger a re-generation, add a warning, cite sources).
  - Evaluate the system's ability to reduce hallucinations on benchmarks.
- **Month 6: Finalization & Documentation**
  - Analyze the contribution of each verifier component, write the final report, and prepare a demo.
